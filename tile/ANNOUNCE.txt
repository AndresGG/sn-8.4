ANNOUNCE: Tile Widget Set, version 0.8.4.0

~ What is it?

The Tile widget set is an experimental reimplementation
of some of the standard Tk widgets.  It is provided as an
extension for use with Tk 8.4.  Since it has been incorporated
into Tk 8.5 you probably don't need this extension.

~ What's New in 0.8.4.0

Tile 0.8.4.0 is a checkpoint release, matching what is included
in Tk 8.5.9 (including all bugs).  It will most likely also match
what is eventually to be available in Tk 8.6.0.

~ Changes since 0.8.2

    + Support for Windows Vista
    + New [ttk::spinbox] widget
    + Improved MouseWheel bindings
    + Improved tag support in treeview widget; new methods
      'tag has', 'tag add', 'tag remove', and 'tag names'
    + Uniform support for [$w identify] methods.
    + Widget states user1, user2, and user3 available for custom widgets
    + Not enough bugfixes

~ On version numbers

The version numbering scheme has changed again.  To prevent conflicts
when application code that calls [package require tile] is run
in a Tk 8.5+ interpreter, the tile extension currently provides
version "0.8.4.0".  Subsequent releases, if any, will be numbered
"0.8.4.X".

As before, the last component of the version number will be incremented
immediately before and immediately after making a release.  Thus
odd-numbered versions indicate a CVS snapshot.
